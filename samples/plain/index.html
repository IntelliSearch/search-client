            <h1>Welcome to the IntelliSearch</h1>
            <p>IntelliSearch is very much like Google. If you can google something then you can also use IntelliSearch to
                find things. The important difference between Google and IntelliSearch is that IntelliSearch lets you find
                things in
                <strong>specific sources</strong>. IntelliSearch does not help you find content anywhere on the internet,
                but it will help you find information anywhere in the indexed sources.
            </p>
            <p>Another important distinction is that IntelliSearch handle security. Google finds any content on the internet,
                and the items it index are all public. IntelliSearch is built from the ground up with security built-in.
                It is set up to authenticate users and to add security for the items added to the search index.
            </p>
            <h2>About this IntelliSearch index</h2>
            <p>This IntelliSearch application is dedicated to content in the following sources:
                <ul>
                    <li class="source">Exchange: All your email</li>
                    <li class="source">Fileserver: All content on the NNN fileserver.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>It is set up to handle authentication and security via Windows Integrated Security, meaning that you need
                to be logged in to the company domain to get any results.
            </p>
            <h2>Tips</h2>
            <dl>
                <dt>Categories:</dt>
                <dd>
                    The category tree is very handy in your quest to help identify the items you are looking for. Clicking on categories makes
                    them filters that filter down results to match the chosen filters. The top-level catgegories are called
                    groups. Each group has categories that can be used for filtering. If you yse multiple filters <strong>within
                        the same group</strong> then these filters are combined with 'OR'. Filters in different groups are
                    combined with 'AND'.<br/> The categories that have been setup by the search administrator should be descriptive
                    for your use case. <br/>
                    <i>Please contact the search administrator for questions in regards to the categories available.</i>
                </dd>

                <dt>Keywords:</dt>
                <dd>
                    Use words that are as special as possible for the items you are looking for. For instance, searching for the word "is" will
                    most likely match on just about all items in the index. We instead recommend using rare words that helps
                    IntelliSearch to identify the items you are looking for.<br/> By default IntelliSearch
                    requires all words in the query to be present to match. After the search is performed you will be presented
                    with an option where you can change this to instead execute a search that requires only one of the words
                    to be present in the items to become a match. The IntelliSearch relevance algorithms will ensure that
                    items that has a better match as listed on top.
                </dd>

                <dt>Phrases:</dt>
                <dd>
                    If you add quotes around the search-expression then IntelliSearch will return only items where those words are used in sequence.
                    I.e. searching for <code>"lisa went to school"</code> instead of just <code>lisa went to school</code>.
                </dd>

                <dt>Sorting:</dt>
                <dd>
                    By default IntelliSearch orders results by relevance, most relevant first to least relevant last. IntelliSearch calculate
                    a match relevance per item it finds and puts the most relevant items on top. If you want you can switch
                    the ordering from Relevance to Date, where items are ordered from newest to oldest.
                    <i>Note that relevance can be tuned in the search-engine. Please contact the search administrator if
                        you have input on how items should be ordered.</i>
                </dd>

                <dt>Number-ranges:</dt>
                <dd>
                    IntelliSearch can also help you find specific numbers in the indexed items. If you search for i.e. <code>100-150</code>                    then
                    IntelliSearch will return all items that has any number between 100 and 150 (inclusive). The order of
                    the expression can even be switched, IntelliSearch will understand that <code>150-100</code> means the
                    same as the previous expressions. You can also search for negative ranges, although the expressions will
                    look a bit weirder. For instance,
                    <code>-100--200</code> will return all items with the numbers -200 to -100 in them.<br />
                    <i>Requires the number-plugin to be enabled in the search-engine.</i>
                </dd>

                <dt>Advanced language features:</dt>
                <dd>
                    IntelliSearch will detect the language used in items and for Norwegian (bokmål as well as ny-norsk) we will amploy what is
                    called 'lemmatization' techniques in order to help identify the items you are looking for. A fallback
                    alternative is used for most other common languages, called 'stemming'. With lemmatization enabled, searching
                    for the word <code>trær</code> for instance, will automatically also return items
                    where the words <code>tre</code>, <code>trær</code>,
                    <code>trærne</code>, <code>treet</code> (etc.) are used.
                    <i>Requires the lemmatization-plugin to be enabled in the search-engine.</i>
